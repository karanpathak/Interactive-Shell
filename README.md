# Interactive Shell
I made a new Linux shell having new commands using Debian Linux Kernel 3.14-kali and available Linux System Calls. It’s a combination of a command-line interface and GUI. I have provided buttons for most frequently occurring commands so that user doesn’t have to remember all the commands and their syntax.
